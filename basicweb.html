            create in group a motivational campaign to gather more youth

            Bert test to understand what would captivate our user and if our
            solution would be interesting. We have also worked with a promotinal
            video to be used in social media.

            Pixel Art and due to it strong appearance, I decided to create a

            based my research on the urban artist "Invader".
