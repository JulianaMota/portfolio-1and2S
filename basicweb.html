            company of exchange programs for youth. And the assignment was to
            create in group a motivational campaign to gather more youth

            a focus group by intreviews, 5 second test, think aloud test and
            Bert test to understand what would captivate our user and if our
            solution would be interesting. We have also worked with a promotinal
            video to be used in social media.

            website with HTML and CSS grid using a given style. My style was
            Pixel Art and due to it strong appearance, I decided to create a

            based my research on the urban artist "Invader".
